# My Portfolio Website Design

Visit my **[portfolio website](https://josephine-c.github.io/)** or my **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/josephine-c?tab=repositories)**.

## Description of website
### Purpose
At the core the purpose of my portfolio website is to gain employment, by allowing potential clients/employers to get to know me by viewing my portfolio and social media links all on one website. There are also details for contacting me directly.

### Features
There are 5 features on my portfolio website. These are:
1. Home (Home/Landing page)
2. About (Bio page)
3. Portfolio (Portfolio/previous works)
4. Skills & Experiance (Skills/Study/Work history page)
5. Contact (Contact page)

These features are divided into different sections of the website in order for viewers to gain access to specific items of information more easily.

The first feature is the homepage or landing page and provides an inviting greeting to the viewer, introducing my name and position/credentials. This will allow the viewer to identify if they have the correct website, without bombarding the viewer with too much information or details. I have made this page clean and simple with a white bold text and a play of two differnet typography fonts, to enable the viewer to focus purely on the greeting details.

The second feature is the 'About' or biography page. This page is to provide more details about myself to the viewer. This is to share what I am passionate about and the purpose of this website, to invite them to collaborate or work with me.

The third feature is the 'Portfolio' page. This shows examples of my work, with links to my digital coding repository on GitHub and my scientific research portfolio (journal articles) on ORCiD. The images used are from my Terminal App Roulette and a protein structure of [GLIC](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6F7A/1), which I had uncovered using lipidic mesophases for protein crystallisation.

The fourth feature is the 'Skills & Experience' page of the website. This section includes all the coding languages and tools I'll be using as a web developer, as well as my background study and work history. I have listed my degrees and positions. The use of a automatic scrolling bar for displaying the companies I have worked for allowed me to keep this page to one page on a mobile screen. I have also displayed the logos for assiociations that I am a member of at the very bottom.

The fifth and final feature of the website is the 'Contact' page. This is one of the most important pages, as it is the purpose of the website - enabling potential collaborators or empolyers veiw my contact details to allow them to contact me. In my website I have provided links to my email, Linkedin, GitHub and ORCiD accounts, by which they can message me respectively. 

### Sitemap

## Design Documentation

### Design Process

#### Mood Board
The mood board was created on my pinterest account. I have a deep affinity to the ocean being a certified Rescue SCUBA Diver. I collected images that would inspire me and set a mood for my portfolio website.
![Mood board](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/moodboard_pinterest_portfolio_website.png "mood board")

#### Color Scheme
I took a few of the images from my mood board to develop and create my own personal color scheme using canva.com. These were the first few images:
![Color scheme 1](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_1.png "Color scheme 1")
![Color scheme 2](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/commit/79f8620c48c10a60f90fb148f0e92568d4eb71ab "Color scheme 2")
![Color scheme 3](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_3.png "Color scheme 3")
![Color scheme 4](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_4.png "Color scheme 4")
![Color scheme 5](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_5.png "Color scheme 5")
![Color scheme 6](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_6.png "Color scheme 6")
![Color scheme 7](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_7.png "Color scheme 7")
![Color scheme 8](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_8.png "Color scheme 8")

I then refined the images I liked:
![Color scheme all](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/final_color_scheme.png "Color scheme all")

I then hand picked the colors I liked from all these selected images to create my own personal color scheme for my portfolio website:
![Color scheme all](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/final_color_scheme_combined.png "Color scheme all")
I then set these colors plus a white, as variables that will dictate which font or background color I use throughout the website:

        $color-white: rgb(255, 255, 255);
        $color-lt-steel-blue:#D3DDE2;
        $color-lt-slate-grey: #7285A0;
        $color-midnight-blue: #0D3F67;
        $color-navy: #041434;
        $color-dk-midnight-blue: #051325;
        $color-dk-midnight-blue2: #0B131D;

#### Typography
I picked two fonts from Google Fonts to used in my entire website:

        $title-font: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;
        $body-font: 'Montserrat', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

![Google fonts](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/both%20fonts.jpg "Google fonts")

1. Permanant Marker (I love this as I tend to write in capitals for my 'To Do' lists, so it seemed quite personal)
![Google font Permanant Marker](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/permanent_marker_font.jpg "Google font Permanant Marker")

2. Montserrat (I like the clean san-serif lines of this font. I wanted my text to be easy to read and look minimal and clean.)
![Google font Montserrat](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/montserrat_san_serif_font.jpg "Google font Montserrat")

#### Photos/Images
All the photos and images used on this website are my own and I thought this was an important design aspect, as it adds a very personal touch to the website. The decision to use a everyday carry (EDC) photo of my hardware and everyday tools in the 'Skills and Experiance' page, allows me to share my personality with the viewer. It adds a personal touch/feeling and hopefully allows the viewer to build a image me of who I am by the tools I use.

### Wireframes

Using butchers paper and pen I mapped out my inital and final wireframe designs for the website considering 3 different screen sizes: mobile (~400px), ipad (min-width: 500px), and laptop (min-width: 1030px).

#### Inital concept (Mobile first design)

### Personal logo

I used logojoy.com to quickly make a personal logo stand-in for this portfolio website project, while I develop my own personal logo properly without the project time constraints. As it is self/personal branding I used my initials JC as the main design component of my logo. I Went with a bright pink color to contrast with with dark blue background of my main/homepage. I love the color pink and had it as my hair dye color for a few years once upon a time. I also made the pink color spill out of the circle to mimic a personal wax seal used on envelopes, to give a more personal touch!

### Usability considerations

Have added in html 'lang="en"' to enable the page to be recognised for reading in English. Have also added 'alt' tags in images in the website, to enable people using the page to voice extension to know what the images/icon/logos are of. Good contrast was also used and check in color section of the Developers Tools on Chrome to ensure that strong contrast is used between text and background, to allow readability for people who may have color blindness. Consistent location of the menu-bar and using icons instead of words will also allow for easy access and viewing. 

## Project Planning Process

### Project plan and timeline

Given 5-6 days to work on this portfolio website project, planning was critical. The project was assigned on 19.3.2019. I used agile project management structure with a core sprint for Design, Build and Stretch goals displayed on Trello. I saved my code consistently using the GIT repository and pushed to GitHUB, to ensure a copy is saved in my GitHUB Repos for safe keeping. 

![Trello](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/trello01.png "Trello")

![Trello 2](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/trello02.jpg "Trello 2")

#### Main sprints:
1.	Design (19.3.2019): Moodboard, typography, wireframe (mobile, laptop), color palette
2.	Build (20.3.2019 – 22.3.2019): HTML, CSS, SASS-CSS (using flexbox, Chrome developer tools for styling)
3.	Stretch (22.3.2019 – 23.3.2019): Debugging, checking responsiveness on different devices and adding 'alt' tags to accessibility for the website, if time permitted animations and burger menu. Need to compile a 5min presentation (pdf) by 24.3.2019.

This project plan helped me stay focused on building the core website and allowed me to explore my stretch goals.

## Short Answer Q & A

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today

1. 1980 - Ethernet standard introduced, allowing computers to be hooked onto a network.
2. 1982 - TCP/IP protocol suite formalized. This the standard for internet data transfer. This year Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was first defined (birth of the email).
3. 1983 - Domain Name System (DNS) introduced to allow domain names to automatically be assigned an IP number.
4. 1985 - First .COM domain name registered.
5. 1990 – A hypertext system is created and implemented by Tim Berners-Lee (CERN).
6. 1991 – CERN releases the World Wide Web publicly on August 6th, 1991.
7. 1993 - Mosaic web browser released.
8. 1994 - Full text web search engines are operational.
9. 1995 - IPv6 proposed (creating more unique IP addresses).
10. 1999 - IEEE 802.11b wireless networking (wifi was born).
11. 2000 - Dot-com bubble bursts on March 10, 2000.
12. 2001 - The spread of P2P file sharing across the Internet.

### Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers

Domain names are a unique text address that people enter, which have a companion IP address recognised by web servers. The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the address book of the Internet and will recognised the domain name and translate it into it's respective IP address so web browsers can load Internet resources. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other computers use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for people to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today

The birth of the electronic mail, otherwise known as email has revolutionised the way people communicate on a global level. Since Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was first defined in 1982, there was no turning back for the way people communicated with each other on computers. The benefits of using emails via the internet was instant messaging, as long as you had access to the internet, no matter what location you were in the world (it did not discriminate against time or location, which was the major limiting factor for postal delivery of mail). We now use email as an official way to receive mail from major services such as universities, heath insurance and even some banks. Along-side the environmental benefits of reducing paper usage from physical letters, it has allowed us to stay in constant contact with loved ones daily from the other side of the earth.
