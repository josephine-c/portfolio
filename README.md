# My Portfolio Website Design

Visit my **[portfolio website](https://josephine-c.github.io/)** or my **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/josephine-c?tab=repositories)**.

## Description of website
### Purpose
At the core the purpose of my portfolio website is to gain employment, by allowing potential clients/employers to get to know me by viewing my portfolio and social media links all on one website. There are also details for contacting me directly.

### Features
There are 5 features on my portfolio website. These are:
1. Home (Home/Landing page)
2. About (Bio page)
3. Portfolio (Portfolio/previous works)
4. Skills & Experiance (Skills/Study/Work history page)
5. Contact (Contact page)

These features are divided into different sections of the website in order for viewers to gain access to specific items of information more easily.

The first feature is the homepage or landing page and provides an inviting greeting to the viewer, introducing my name and position/credentials. This will allow the viewer to identify if they have the correct website, without bombarding the viewer with too much information or details. I have made this page clean and simple with a white bold text and a play of two differnet typography fonts, to enable the viewer to focus purely on the greeting details.

The second feature is the 'About' or biography page. This page is to provide more details about myself to the viewer. This is to share what I am passionate about and the purpose of this website, to invite them to collaborate or work with me.

The third feature is the 'Portfolio' page. This shows examples of my work, with links to my digital coding repository on GitHub and my scientific research portfolio (journal articles) on ORCiD. The images used are from my Terminal App Roulette and a protein structure of [GLIC](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6F7A/1), which I had uncovered using lipidic mesophases for protein crystallisation.

The fourth feature is the 'Skills & Experience' page of the website. This section includes all the coding languages and tools I'll be using as a web developer, as well as my background study and work history. I have listed my degrees and positions. The use of a automatic scrolling bar for displaying the companies I have worked for allowed me to keep this page to one page on a mobile screen. I have also displayed the logos for assiociations that I am a member of at the very bottom.

The fifth and final feature of the website is the 'Contact' page. This is one of the most important pages, as it is the purpose of the website - enabling potential collaborators or empolyers veiw my contact details to allow them to contact me. In my website I have provided links to my email, Linkedin, GitHub and ORCiD accounts, by which they can message me respectively. 

### Sitemap

The sitemap shows the layout and flow of the website, and how all the pages are accessible via the menu-bar or by scrolling up and down the page.

### Design Process

### Mood Board
The mood board was created on my pinterest account. I have a deep affinity to the ocean being a certified Rescue SCUBA Diver. I collected images that would inspire me and set a mood for my portfolio website.

### Wireframes

Using butchers paper and pen I mapped out my inital and final wireframe designs for the website considering 3 different screen sizes: mobile (~400px), ipad (min-width: 500px), and laptop (min-width: 1030px).

#### Inital concept (Mobile first design)

##### For Mobile and iPad

### Usability considerations

Have added in html 'lang="en"' to enable the page to be recognised for reading in English. Have also added 'alt' tags in images in the website, to enable people using the page to voice extension to know what the images/icon/logos are of. Good contrast was also used and check in color section of the Developers Tools on Chrome to ensure that strong contrast is used between text and background, to allow readability for people who may have color blindness. Consistent location of the menu-bar and using icons instead of words will also allow for easy access and viewing.
