# My Portfolio Website Design

Visit my **[portfolio website](https://josephine-c.github.io/)** or my **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/josephine-c?tab=repositories)**.

## Description of website
### Purpose
At the core the purpose of my portfolio website is to gain employment, by allowing potential clients/employers to get to know me by viewing my portfolio and social media links all on one website. There are also details for contacting me directly.

### Features
There are 5 features on my portfolio website. These are:
1. Home (Home/Landing page)
2. About (Bio page)
3. Portfolio (Portfolio/previous works)
4. Skills & Experiance (Skills/Study/Work history page)
5. Contact (Contact page)

These features are divided into different sections of the website in order for viewers to gain access to specific items of information more easily.

The first feature is the homepage or landing page and provides an inviting greeting to the viewer, introducing my name and position/credentials. This will allow the viewer to identify if they have the correct website, without bombarding the viewer with too much information or details. I have made this page clean and simple with a white bold text and a play of two differnet typography fonts, to enable the viewer to focus purely on the greeting details.

The second feature is the 'About' or biography page. This page is to provide more details about myself to the viewer. This is to share what I am passionate about and the purpose of this website, to invite them to collaborate or work with me.

The third feature is the 'Portfolio' page. This shows examples of my work, with links to my digital coding repository on GitHub and my scientific research portfolio (journal articles) on ORCiD. The images used are from my Terminal App Roulette and a protein structure of [GLIC](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6F7A/1), which I had uncovered using lipidic mesophases for protein crystallisation.

The fourth feature is the 'Skills & Experience' page of the website. This section includes all the coding languages and tools I'll be using as a web developer, as well as my background study and work history. I have listed my degrees and positions. The use of a automatic scrolling bar for displaying the companies I have worked for allowed me to keep this page to one page on a mobile screen. I have also displayed the logos for assiociations that I am a member of at the very bottom.

The fifth and final feature of the website is the 'Contact' page. This is one of the most important pages, as it is the purpose of the website - enabling potential collaborators or empolyers veiw my contact details to allow them to contact me. In my website I have provided links to my email, Linkedin, GitHub and ORCiD accounts, by which they can message me respectively. 

### Sitemap

![Image of sitemap](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/sitemap.png "sitemap")

The sitemap shows the layout and flow of the website, and how all the pages are accessible via the menu-bar or by scrolling up and down the page.

## Design Documentation

### Design Process

#### Mood Board
The mood board was created on my pinterest account. I have a deep affinity to the ocean being a certified Rescue SCUBA Diver. I collected images that would inspire me and set a mood for my portfolio website.
![Mood board](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/moodboard_pinterest_portfolio_website.png "mood board")

#### Color Scheme
I took a few of the images from my mood board to develop and create my own personal color scheme using canva.com. These were the first few images:
![Color scheme 1](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_1.png "Color scheme 1")
![Color scheme 2](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/commit/79f8620c48c10a60f90fb148f0e92568d4eb71ab "Color scheme 2")
![Color scheme 3](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_3.png "Color scheme 3")
![Color scheme 4](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_4.png "Color scheme 4")
![Color scheme 5](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_5.png "Color scheme 5")
![Color scheme 6](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_6.png "Color scheme 6")
![Color scheme 7](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_7.png "Color scheme 7")
![Color scheme 8](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/color_scheme_8.png "Color scheme 8")

I then refined the images I liked:
![Color scheme all](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/final_color_scheme.png "Color scheme all")

I then hand picked the colors I liked from all these selected images to create my own personal color scheme for my portfolio website:
![Color scheme all](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/final_color_scheme_combined.png "Color scheme all")
I then set these colors plus a white, as variables that will dictate which font or background color I use throughout the website:

        $color-white: rgb(255, 255, 255);
        $color-lt-steel-blue:#D3DDE2;
        $color-lt-slate-grey: #7285A0;
        $color-midnight-blue: #0D3F67;
        $color-navy: #041434;
        $color-dk-midnight-blue: #051325;
        $color-dk-midnight-blue2: #0B131D;

#### Typography
I picked two fonts from Google Fonts to used in my entire website:

        $title-font: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;
        $body-font: 'Montserrat', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

![Google fonts](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/both%20fonts.jpg "Google fonts")

1. Permanant Marker (I love this as I tend to write in capitals for my 'To Do' lists, so it seemed quite personal)
![Google font Permanant Marker](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/permanent_marker_font.jpg "Google font Permanant Marker")

2. Montserrat (I like the clean san-serif lines of this font. I wanted my text to be easy to read and look minimal and clean.)
![Google font Montserrat](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/montserrat_san_serif_font.jpg "Google font Montserrat")

#### Photos/Images
All the photos and images used on this website are my own and I thought this was an important design aspect, as it adds a very personal touch to the website. The decision to use a everyday carry (EDC) photo of my hardware and everyday tools in the 'Skills and Experiance' page, allows me to share my personality with the viewer. It adds a personal touch/feeling and hopefully allows the viewer to build a image me of who I am by the tools I use.

### Wireframes

Using butchers paper and pen I mapped out my inital and final wireframe designs for the website considering 3 different screen sizes: mobile (~400px), ipad (min-width: 500px), and laptop (min-width: 1030px).

#### Inital concept (Mobile first design)

#### Final design concept (Mobile/iPad/laptop)
##### For Mobile and iPad

### Personal logo

I used logojoy.com to quickly make a personal logo stand-in for this portfolio website project, while I develop my own personal logo properly without the project time constraints. As it is self/personal branding I used my initials JC as the main design component of my logo. I Went with a bright pink color to contrast with with dark blue background of my main/homepage. I love the color pink and had it as my hair dye color for a few years once upon a time. I also made the pink color spill out of the circle to mimic a personal wax seal used on envelopes, to give a more personal touch!

![personal logo](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/logo-70px.png "personal logo")


### Usability considerations

Have added in html 'lang="en"' to enable the page to be recognised for reading in English. Have also added 'alt' tags in images in the website, to enable people using the page to voice extension to know what the images/icon/logos are of. Good contrast was also used and check in color section of the Developers Tools on Chrome to ensure that strong contrast is used between text and background, to allow readability for people who may have color blindness. Consistent location of the menu-bar and using icons instead of words will also allow for easy access and viewing. 

## Project Planning Process

### Project plan and timeline

Given 5-6 days to work on this portfolio website project, planning was critical. The project was assigned on 19.3.2019. I used agile project management structure with a core sprint for Design, Build and Stretch goals displayed on Trello. I saved my code consistently using the GIT repository and pushed to GitHUB, to ensure a copy is saved in my GitHUB Repos for safe keeping. 

![Trello](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/trello01.png "Trello")

![Trello 2](https://github.com/josephine-c/portfolio/blob/master/docs/trello02.jpg "Trello 2")

#### Main sprints:
1.	Design (19.3.2019): Moodboard, typography, wireframe (mobile, laptop), color palette
2.	Build (20.3.2019 – 22.3.2019): HTML, CSS, SASS-CSS (using flexbox, Chrome developer tools for styling)
3.	Stretch (22.3.2019 – 23.3.2019): Debugging, checking responsiveness on different devices and adding 'alt' tags to accessibility for the website, if time permitted animations and burger menu. Need to compile a 5min presentation (pdf) by 24.3.2019.

This project plan helped me stay focused on building the core website and allowed me to explore my stretch goals.

## Short Answer Q & A

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

In 1981 The National Science Foundation releases CSNET 56 to allow computers to network without being connected to the government networks. This form of networking between computers birthed the concept of the internet, with the transfer of information between private computers.

In 1983 the migration of the ARPANet to TCP/IP was officially completed on Janurary 1, when the new protocols were permanently activatied. TCP/IP becomes the standard for internet protocol.

### Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domains (address) name - a text name to an IP
Web servers (host the that address) - hardware- a computer - running for access (without user interface) - host domains, files, 
DNS - phonebook for translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
Web browsing 
web browsers - is software that allow humans to access the internet got to domains/ip

The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

Email - global instant communication - not reliant on the postal service, instant free communication between any persons with email addresses. impact of this on the modern world is immesurable as it speeds up the process of internet messaging has replaced every other form of communication
